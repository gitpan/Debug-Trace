Debug/Trace version 0.04
========================

Debug::Trace instruments subroutines to provide tracing information
upon every call and return.

Using Debug::Trace does not require any changes to your sources. Most
often, it will be used from the command line:

  perl -MDebug::Trace=foo,bar yourprogram.pl

This will have your subroutines foo() and bar() printing call and
return information.

Subroutine names may be fully qualified to denote subroutines in other
packages than the default main::.

By default, the trace information is output using the standard warn()
function.

Modifiers are supported to change the default behavior.
